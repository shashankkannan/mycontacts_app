# Contacts React Project

This is a simple React project that manages contacts in JSON file. The project contains two main pages:

1. **Home Page**: The landing page of the application.
2. **View JSON Page**: A page to view JSON data - add, delete, edit, search contacts data.


## Features

- **React Router**: Navigation between multiple pages.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shashankkannan/mycontacts_app.git

2. Install the required dependencies:

   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
