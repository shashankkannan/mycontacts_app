# React Project

This is a simple React project that manages contacts in JSON file. The project contains two main pages:

1. **Home Page**: The landing page of the application.
2. **View JSON Page**: A page to view JSON data - add, delete, edit, search contacts data.

## Description

This React project uses `react-router-dom` to handle routing between the pages. 

## Features

- **React Router**: Navigation between multiple pages.
- **Component-based Structure**: Pages are broken into separate components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes. The app uses pagination to manage contacts data.
